Starting Fall 2024, I will be the Ram√≥n Areces Fellow and Visiting Scholar for 2024-2025 at the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center of European Studies</a> in <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>.</p> <p>I specialize in comparative politics, electoral behavior, representation, and public opinion. I co-direct the electoral prediction market <a href="http://predilect.org" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Predilect</a> and co-lead WG1 at <a href="https://www.lgbtinequalities.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">COST Action LGBTI+ Social and Economic (in)equalities (CA19103)</a>. Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Zurich.</p> <p>My research focuses on two key and interconnected challenges that modern democracies face: identity-based polarization and the erosion of sociocultural attitudes, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ perspectives, towards liberal democracy. I have also specialized in understanding the discrimination patterns against LGBTQ+ and other minority political candidates in the European context. My methodological expertise is in quantitative techniques, with a specific emphasis on experimental survey methods.</p> </body></html>
