##### Political Scientist, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Social Sciences, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). Starting Fall 2024, I will be the Ram√≥n Areces Fellow and Visiting Scholar for 2024-2025 at the [Center of European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/) in [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). Starting July 2025, I will be a tenured Assistant Professor at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), where I will develop my [VENI project](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme) on how ethnic norms impact citizens' (il)liberal democratic attitudes.

I specialize in comparative politics, electoral behavior, representation, and public opinion. I co-direct the electoral prediction market [Predilect](http://predilect.org) and co-lead WG1 at [COST Action LGBTI+ Social and Economic (in)equalities (CA19103)](https://www.lgbtinequalities.eu/). Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Zurich.

My research focuses on two key and interconnected challenges that modern democracies face: identity-based polarization and the erosion of sociocultural attitudes, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ perspectives in relation to liberal democracy. I have also specialized in understanding the discrimination patterns against LGBTQ+ and other minority political candidates within the European context. My methodological expertise is in quantitative techniques, with a specific emphasis on experimental survey methods.

Some of my research has been published in _Nature Human Behaviour_, _Science Advances_, _American Political Science Review_, and _Political Behavior_, among other outlets.
