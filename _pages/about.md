##### Political Scientist, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en)


I am a postdoctoral researcher in Political Science at the Faculty of Social Sciences, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). Starting Fall 2024, I will be the Ram√≥n Areces Fellow and Visiting Scholar for 2024-2025 at the [Center of European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/) in [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/).


I specialize in comparative politics, electoral behavior, representation, and public opinion. I co-direct the electoral prediction market [Predilect](http://predilect.org) and co-lead WG1 at [COST Action LGBTI+ Social and Economic (in)equalities (CA19103)](https://www.lgbtinequalities.eu/). Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Zurich.

My research focuses on two key and interconnected challenges that modern democracies face: identity-based polarization and the erosion of sociocultural attitudes, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ perspectives, towards liberal democracy. I have also specialized in understanding the discrimination patterns against LGBTQ+ and other minority political candidates in the European context. My methodological expertise is in quantitative techniques, with a specific emphasis on experimental survey methods.
