We are a network of researchers working on LGBTI+ inequalities across Europe and beyond. The network is interdisciplinary in nature and focuses on identifying and addressing social and economic challenges faced by LGBTI+ communities as well as supporting future generations of scholars working in this field.

By uniting researchers, civil society organizations, industry partners, and stakeholders, we believe we can address inequalities experienced by LGBTI+ communities.

Currently, I am part of the Core Group as a co-leader of the WG1 on Families and Communities.
